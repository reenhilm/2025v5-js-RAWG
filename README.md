## Project I created in my accelerated course in frontend development

A TODO-list where items are saved in Local Storage with custom categories where the categories are fetched from an API.

It's niched for NES 8bit games and the challenges I can put up for myself in those games.

### Demonstrates
- Use of an API written in vanilla javascript. CRUD functionality in Local Storage.
- CSS skills using grid/subgrid/media-queries and will follow you prefered dark-mode windows setting if you have one.

### To run this project
- Register for an APIKEY [rawg.io](https://rawg.io/apidocs) [^1]

- Create a file a file in scripts/apikey.js with the following contents:  
`const APIKEY = 'PUTAPIKEYHERE';`  
`export default APIKEY`
